Following the tutorial from GitHub

I taught high school English for 5 years and, after realizing it wasn't really for me, I am on a mission to find my passions in life. I spend a lot of time on my computer playing video games, and one day, inbetween games, I made a Codecademy account and started to screw around. I discovered I enjoyed what I was doing: it's like solving puzzles on your computer. Anyway, I hope to keep practicing at coding and improve my skills!
